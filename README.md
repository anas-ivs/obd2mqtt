# OBD2MQTT – BLE-OBD2 → MQTT → Home Assistant

> **Beta.** Tested on a Hyundai IONIQ 5.

**[⬇ Download: latest firmware (Releases)](../../releases/latest)** · [Manual](docs/manual_en.html) · [Changelog](CHANGELOG.en.md)

ESP32 firmware that connects via Bluetooth LE to an ELM327-compatible OBD2 dongle in the car, polls configurable PIDs and publishes the values via MQTT (with Home Assistant auto-discovery). Everything is configured through a web interface – no YAML, no programming.

**Recommended setup:** the ESP32 stays in the garage (on WiFi, USB power supply), the dongle stays plugged into the car. As soon as the car is within BLE range (typically 5–15 m), values arrive in Home Assistant.

```

## Features

- BLE client for ELM327 dongles (auto-detects common UUIDs: FFF0, FFE0, 18F0, vLinker; can be overridden manually)
- Vehicle profiles as JSON (pre-installed: Hyundai IONIQ 5 / Kia EV6), editable in the web UI
- Web interface and built-in manual (English), backup/restore of all settings, log with real time (NTP)
- PIDs with freely definable formulas (`B34/2`, `u16(B28,B29)/10`, `s16(..)`, `s8(..)`, `bit(x,n)`)
- **Test button** per PID: shows every response byte with its index so you can easily find byte positions
- ELM327 terminal in the browser
- MQTT auto-discovery: sensors appear automatically as a device in Home Assistant
- 12 V protection (ATRV), pause when the car doesn't respond, BLE disconnects between polls so the dongle can sleep
- Setup access point with captive portal, mDNS (`http://obd2mqtt.local`), OTA updates, optional password protection
- **Online update** from the GitHub releases: daily check, changelog of the new version, install with one click (web interface or Home Assistant update entity)
- Watchdog with automatic restart and safe mode
- **Diagnostic report** (one click, copy/download, no WiFi/IP/passwords) and a 2-hour diagnostic log – ideal for beta testers

## What you need

- **ESP32 dev board** (classic ESP32, e.g. ESP32-DevKitC V4) with a USB power supply, within BLE range of the car
- **Bluetooth LE OBD2 dongle**, ELM327-compatible, e.g. vLinker MC+/FS, Veepeak BLE+, OBDLink CX, Vgate iCar Pro BLE or WiCAN Pro (BLE + protocol "elm327", PIN under Settings → BLE dongle). *Classic Bluetooth (SPP) dongles without "LE" do not work.*
- Home Assistant with an MQTT broker (e.g. the Mosquitto add-on)

## Flashing

**Option A – no toolchain (classic ESP32):**
Download `obd2mqtt-vX.Y.Z-esp32-factory.bin` from [Releases](../../releases/latest) and flash it at **address 0x0** with a web flasher in Chrome/Edge (e.g. https://espressif.github.io/esptool-js/).

**Option B – PlatformIO (all boards):**
```bash
pio run -e esp32dev -t upload      # classic ESP32
pio run -e esp32s3 -t upload       # ESP32-S3
pio run -e esp32c3 -t upload       # ESP32-C3
pio device monitor
```

Later updates: web UI → System → Firmware update with `obd2mqtt-vX.Y.Z-esp32-ota.bin` from the releases (after `pio run` it is copied to `firmware/obd2mqtt-vX.Y.Z-<env>-ota.bin` automatically).

## First setup

1. After the first boot the ESP32 opens the WiFi network **`OBD2MQTT-xxxx`** (password `obd2mqtt`). Connect and open http://192.168.4.1.
2. **Settings → WiFi**: enter SSID and password, then **MQTT**: broker, user and password.
3. **BLE dongle**: park the car with the dongle plugged in nearby, then click "Scan for dongles". Entries marked with ★ are most likely OBD adapters. Click the entry.
4. "Save & restart". Afterwards the interface is available at `http://obd2mqtt.local` or the assigned IP address.
5. **Profile**: select the matching profile and click "Activate". Click "Test" next to `soc` to check that a value comes back.

## Profiles

All values of the factory profiles are enabled by default; you can switch individual values off in the profile.

### Hyundai IONIQ 5 (also Kia EV6 / IONIQ 6, E-GMP)

Init: `ATZ ATE0 ATL0 ATS0 ATH0 ATSP6 ATAT0 ATSTFF ATFCSH7E4 ATFCSD300000 ATFCSM1`. `ATAT0` (no adaptive timing) and the explicit flow control make long responses (`220101`, 62 bytes) reliable on cheap ELM327 clones – in a test with an "OBDII v1.5" dongle it went from 0 of 3 to 6 of 7 complete responses. The flow-control address follows each header change automatically (`7E4`, `7C6`, `7A0`).

| ID | Header | Command | Formula | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `soc` | 7E4 | 220105 | `B34/2` | displayed SoC |
| `bat_temp_max` / `bat_temp_min` | 7E4 | 220101 | `s8(B17)` / `s8(B18)` | battery temperature °C |
| `odometer` | 7C6 | 22B002 | `B9*65536+B10*256+B11` | odometer (instrument cluster, usually only with ignition on) |
| `range_calc` | 7E4 | 220105 | `B34/2*CAP/CONS` | **calculated** range |
| `soc_bms` | 7E4 | 220101 | `B7/2` | BMS SoC |
| `soh` | 7E4 | 220105 | `u16(B28,B29)/10` | state of health |
| `hv_current` / `hv_voltage` | 7E4 | 220101 | `s16(B13,B14)/10` / `u16(B15,B16)/10` | HV current (negative = charging) / HV voltage |
| `charge_power` | 7E4 | 220101 | `max(0,-s16(B13,B14)*u16(B15,B16)/100000)` | charging power kW |
| `charging` / `charging_dc` | 7E4 | 220101 | `lt(s16(B13,B14),-5)` / `gt(…kW…,11.5)` | charging (current < −0.5 A) / DC charging (> 11.5 kW) – confirmed on an IONIQ 5 (AC charging 3.7 kW: −7.0 A at 527.5 V). The charging bits in byte 12 always stay 0 on the IONIQ 5 |
| `tyre_p_fl/fr/rl/rr` | 7A0 | 22C00B | `B7`/`B12`/`B17`/`B22` `*0.2/14.5038` | tyre pressure bar (raw × 0.2 psi) – TPMS, probably only with ignition on |
| `tyre_t_fl/fr/rl/rr` | 7A0 | 22C00B | `B8`/`B13`/`B18`/`B23` `-50` | tyre temperature °C |

### Range

The car does not report the dashboard range via OBD – neither evDash nor WiCAN nor OVMS read it. `range_calc` therefore estimates it: SoC × usable capacity ÷ consumption. Under **Profile → Battery & range** you pick your battery variant from a list (known sizes pre-filled, value can be corrected by hand) and enter your average consumption in kWh/100 km. Formulas can use the variables `CAP` (usable kWh) and `CONS` (kWh/100 km). Pre-filled variants (usable capacity): IONIQ 5 58/63/72.6/77.4/84 kWh (≈54/60/70/74/80).

### Converting WiCAN profiles

WiCAN counts the bytes of the raw CAN frames including the ISO-TP control bytes; here only the payload is counted:

- Single-frame response: our `B` = WiCAN `B` − 1
- Multi-frame response: WiCAN `B2…B7` → our `B0…B5`; then WiCAN `B9…B15` → `B6…B12`, `B17…B23` → `B13…B19` etc. (every 8th byte is dropped)
- WiCAN `S21` (signed) → `s8(B17)`, `[B19:B20]` → `u16(..)`, `B15:7` (bit) → `bit(B12,7)`

Values flagged `"sleep_zero": true` in the profile JSON (e.g. charging power, charging) are set to 0 when the car falls asleep, so Home Assistant does not keep showing the last charging value.

### Adding your own PIDs

1. Profile → "+ PID", then enter header, command and a first formula (e.g. `B3`).
2. Click "Test". The bytes are shown with their index (B0, B1, …). `B0` is always the service byte of the response, i.e. 0x62 for mode 22 or 0x41 for mode 01.
3. Adjust the formula until the value is plausible. Min/max act as a plausibility filter so outliers are discarded.
4. Tick "Active" and click "Save profile". Home Assistant creates the sensor automatically.

## Watchdog & safe mode

- **Hang:** if the main loop doesn't respond for more than 60 s, the ESP32 restarts automatically.
- **Connectivity:** if WiFi is gone for 15 min or MQTT for 20 min, it restarts as well – unless someone is connected to the setup WiFi.
- **Safe mode:** after **3 crashes or watchdog resets in a row** the firmware starts without Bluetooth and polling. The web interface stays reachable and the status page shows a red notice. Once you have fixed the profile or settings, "Restart normally" returns to normal operation. The counter resets after 3 min of stable operation or a power cycle.
- *System* shows the reason for the last restart, e.g. "Task watchdog (firmware hung)" or "Brownout".

## MQTT

| Topic | Content |
|---|---|
| `obd2mqtt/<pid-id>` | measured value (retained), e.g. `obd2mqtt/soc` → `54.5` |
| `obd2mqtt/voltage_12v` | 12 V voltage measured at the dongle |
| `obd2mqtt/car` | `online` / `offline` – dongle reachable |
| `obd2mqtt/polling` | `ON` / `OFF` – main switch for automatic polling; switch it via `obd2mqtt/polling/set` (in HA: switch "Polling") |
| `obd2mqtt/battery_low` | `ON` / `OFF` – 12 V battery below the warning threshold (default 12.0 V) |
| `obd2mqtt/car_awake` | `ON` / `OFF` – car awake (12 V above the sleep threshold, i.e. DC/DC converter active) |
| `obd2mqtt/ble_rssi` | BLE signal strength |
| `obd2mqtt/last_error` | last error |
| `obd2mqtt/status` | `online` / `offline` (last will of the bridge) |
| `obd2mqtt/profile` | name of the active vehicle profile, e.g. `Hyundai IONIQ 5 / Kia EV6` (retained) |
| `obd2mqtt/profile/attributes` | details as JSON: `{"id":"ioniq5","name":"Hyundai IONIQ 5 / Kia EV6","model":"…","active_pids":[…],"firmware":"…"}` |
| `obd2mqtt/state` | all current values incl. profile as **one** JSON after every poll cycle: `{"profile":"Hyundai IONIQ 5 / Kia EV6","profile_id":"ioniq5","time":"…","values":{"soc":71.5,…},"voltage_12v":12.6}` |

Discovery is published under `homeassistant/sensor/obd2mqtt_xxxxxx/<id>/config`.

## Notes

- **Let the car sleep:** every OBD request wakes the car. If the 12 V voltage is below 13.2 V (car off, not charging), the bridge sends no requests and only watches the voltage; as soon as the car wakes up by itself, normal polling resumes. Adjustable under Settings → Polling.
- **12 V battery:** by default the car is polled only every 120 s, BLE is disconnected in between and polling pauses below 12.2 V. If the car doesn't respond (it's asleep), the bridge waits 10 min. Use a dongle with auto-sleep (e.g. Vgate iCar Pro BLE, vLinker MC+/FS BLE, OBDLink CX).
- **When does the car respond?** On the IONIQ 5 the BMS usually only responds with ignition on or while charging. While asleep you get `NO DATA`. The last value is kept in Home Assistant (retained).
- Only **BLE** dongles (Bluetooth 4.0+) are supported, no Bluetooth Classic adapters (SPP).
- **Dongle quality matters:** cheap clones ("OBDII v1.5", MTU 23) often deliver long multi-frame responses truncated – the bridge retries, but values arrive later and the log shows retries. Good dongles (WiCAN Pro, vLinker, Vgate iCar 2S Pro, OBDLink CX; MTU 247) are noticeably more reliable. A BLE dongle accepts only **one** connection: close OBD apps on your phone (or switch off Bluetooth) while the bridge is running.
- **Connection drops (reason 0x208):** if the connection drops repeatedly right after connecting, the bridge switches to slower BLE connection parameters by itself (shown in the log and in the diagnostic report).
- **Watchdog restart:** after a hang the log now also shows *where* the firmware hung (e.g. "Firmware hung at: BLE subscribe/pairing").
- Commands expect `ATH0`/`ATS0`/`ATCAF1` (set in the init commands).

The factory profiles only send diagnostic **read** requests (UDS 0x22 / OBD2 mode 01); the terminal, however, can send arbitrary commands – at your own responsibility. Values without guarantee; the display in the vehicle is always authoritative. A permanently plugged-in dongle draws power; unplug it if the car is parked for a longer time.
