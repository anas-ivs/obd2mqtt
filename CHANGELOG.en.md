# Changelog

## 0.4.0
- English only: web interface, manual, log messages, Home Assistant names and factory profile; language switch removed. Manual now at /help (/hilfe redirects)
- Only the Hyundai IONIQ 5 / Kia EV6 profile is included (XPeng profiles removed); startup repair of old profiles removed
- New: tyre pressure (bar) and temperature for all four tyres (TPMS 7A0 / 22C00B)
- Faster web interface: pages sent gzip-compressed and cached (304), log only fetched when it changes, lighter status polling, polling paused in hidden browser tabs
- Test and Terminal now run between values of a poll cycle instead of waiting for the whole cycle
- Less load in the main loop: BLE signal read every 2 s, file system usage cached, log written to flash in batches
- Online update checks github.com/anas-ivs/obd2mqtt; default time zone Malaysia (MYT-8)

## 0.3.23
- New: online update (System → Online update) – checks the latest release on GitHub, shows the changes since the installed version and installs the *-esp32-ota.bin directly from the internet at the push of a button (encrypted connection with certificate check, size and image check, then restart)
- Automatic check 3 min after start and then daily (can be switched off in the settings); a new version is noted in the log
- Home Assistant: new update entity “Firmware” – shows installed and latest version, “Install” starts the online update
- Fix: “Download backup” produced an empty file (0 bytes) – the backup was built completely in RAM (JSON document, text and another copy for the response, together ~3 × 30 KB), which failed when memory was tight. It is now sent in pieces: settings, then every profile directly from its file
- Restore needs less memory: the uploaded file is parsed directly in the receive buffer instead of being copied twice

## 0.3.22
- WiFi: after a disconnect the bridge reconnects by itself every 30 s – the ESP32's automatic reconnect got stuck on some disconnect reasons until the watchdog restarted after 15 min
- WiFi: disconnect reason in the log (e.g. “reason 200: beacon timeout (weak signal / interference)”) with the last signal value; the signal strength is shown when connecting
- Time: implausible NTP times (before the firmware build or more than 5 years after it, e.g. 2034) are discarded and requested again; until a valid time is available the log shows the uptime

## 0.3.21
- Watchdog: after a hang the log shows where the firmware hung (e.g. “Firmware hung at: BLE subscribe/pairing”) – also in the diagnostic report
- BLE connection setup hardened: the watchdog is fed before every step, setup is aborted after 20 s and retried later (previously a hanging connection setup or PIN pairing could trigger the 60 s watchdog); the device name is only read on the first connection
- If the connection drops during initialisation, it is aborted immediately (instead of reporting every init line as “without prompt”)
- If the connection drops during polling, there is no 10 min pause (“No valid response”) any more – retry after 60 s; error “BLE disconnected” instead of “ATSH… failed”
- New: if the connection drops repeatedly right after connecting (reason 0x208), the bridge automatically uses slower BLE connection parameters (30–50 ms instead of 7.5–15 ms) – shown in the log, diagnostic report and status
- Warm-up: after connecting, a short “Tester Present” (3E00) is sent to the ECU before the first query – against the truncated first long response (only when the car is awake)
- Cleaner log: no [diag] init lines during the minute-by-minute voltage check while asleep; “BLE pairing OK” only the first time; “Dongle not reachable” while the car sleeps only once (dongle sleeps with the car), plus “Dongle reachable again”
- RSSI: invalid readings right after connecting (e.g. −128 dBm) are shown as “not measured yet”
- Diagnostic report: up to 3 connection attempts, clean abort with a note on connection loss, restart reason, BLE parameters, drops and RSSI at the end
- Fix: when scanning again the dongle name was missing (MAC only) – the name from the scan response is now remembered; for the configured dongle the known name is shown as a fallback
- Formulas: the last value of any other value is available by its ID (e.g. hv_voltage) – for quantities from two responses
- XPeng G9/G6/P7+: new values charging power (kW), charging and DC charging from HV current × HV voltage (first G9 test: 713 V × −10.5 A ≈ 7.5 kW while AC charging); “Charging status” is now called “raw value” (the G9 returned 1 while AC charging); existing XPeng profiles are extended automatically

## 0.3.20
- Fix: “Last error” in MQTT still stayed – the old value is retained in the broker and was never overwritten after a restart; also the reset waited for rarely polled values. Now: “none” after every error-free poll cycle, and the current state is sent immediately when MQTT connects

## 0.3.19
- Fix: “Last error” was never reset – as soon as all active values are read without errors again it is cleared (status page empty, Home Assistant “none”)

## 0.3.18
- Charging values set to 0 when the car falls asleep: if the car fell asleep right after charging, Home Assistant kept showing the last charging power – charging power, charging, DC charging, HV current (XPeng: charge status, HV current) are now set to 0 when the car falls asleep
- Profiles: new per-value field “sleep_zero” (in the JSON editor) – set the value to 0 when the car falls asleep; existing factory-derived profiles are extended automatically
- Note: the charging power is the power arriving in the battery (HV voltage × HV current) – measured at the wallbox it is about 10 % higher when AC charging (test: 3.7 kW in the battery at 4.1 kW at the wallbox)

## 0.3.17
- IONIQ 5: “Charging” and “DC charging” are now detected from the HV current (the charging bits in 220101 byte 12 always stay 0 on the IONIQ 5) – confirmed during AC charging: −7.0 A at 527.5 V = 3.7 kW
- IONIQ 5: new values HV current, HV voltage and charging power (kW); existing IONIQ profiles are extended automatically
- Formulas: new functions lt(a,b), gt(a,b), min(a,b), max(a,b)

## 0.3.16
- New: dongles with pairing PIN (e.g. WiCAN Pro via Bluetooth) – Settings → BLE dongle → “PIN / passkey”; the bridge pairs automatically (encrypted connection, stored bond), messages in the log; with a wrong PIN the bond is discarded
- Manual: section “Dongle with PIN (e.g. WiCAN Pro)”

## 0.3.15
- New: Profile → “Battery & range” – pick the battery variant from a list (known sizes pre-filled: IONIQ 5 58–84 kWh, G9, G6, P7+), capacity can be corrected by hand, consumption in kWh/100 km, calculated full range shown
- Formulas can use the variables CAP (usable kWh) and CONS (kWh/100 km); the range formulas of the factory profiles use them (“Test” uses the values from the form)
- Stored profiles are converted: old range formula “…/100*kWh/consumption” → CAP/CONS with the values taken over, battery selection list added
- IONIQ 5 factory profile: ATAT0 (no adaptive timing) and explicit flow control (ATFCSH7E4, ATFCSD300000, ATFCSM1) – long responses like 220101 almost never arrived complete with an “OBDII v1.5” clone, now 6 of 7 in a test; unmodified IONIQ profiles are converted automatically
- With user-defined flow control (ATFCSM1) the flow-control address follows every header change automatically (e.g. 7E4 → 7C6 for the odometer)
- MQTT: battery capacity and consumption in the profile attributes

## 0.3.14
- Fix: in sleep mode “BLE disconnected (reason 0x216)” was still logged every minute – filled the log in about 4 hours and pushed out older entries

## 0.3.13
- Lower memory use: log download and diagnostic report are sent in 1 KB chunks instead of being built completely in RAM – previously “Download/Copy” briefly needed up to ~40 KB of heap (measured minimum 25 KB)
- Diagnostic report is fetched via /api/diag (no longer inside the job JSON)

## 0.3.12
- New: diagnostic report (Status → Diagnostics) – fresh connection, every init response (rejected commands marked), ATI/AT@1/ATRV/ATDPN, every query of the profile with raw response, response time, indexed bytes and calculated values, summary; copy/download; without WiFi, IP and password data (dongle MAC shortened)
- New: diagnostic log for 2 hours – every request with raw response, init responses, voltage/protocol/MTU on each connection; switches itself off
- Init commands rejected by the dongle (“?”) are now always logged
- Manual: guide “Diagnostic report for beta testers”

## 0.3.11
- XPeng G6/G9/P7+: init sequence fixed – ATFCSD300000 added before ATFCSM1 (otherwise the ELM327 rejects the user-defined flow control and multi-frame responses never arrive; bug from the WiCAN profile), plus ATAL
- Stored profiles are repaired automatically at startup (missing ATFCSD added, 7DF queries disabled when a fixed receive filter ATCRA is set) – noted in the log
- XPeng factory profiles: “SoC (OBD2 standard)” removed – it could never answer because of the receive filter on 784
- Sleep mode with hysteresis like WiCAN: sleep below the threshold, awake only from threshold + 0.1 V
- Polling while asleep (every N min) only above 11.9 V
- New: 12V warning – Home Assistant sensor “12V low” (<base>/battery_low) below an adjustable threshold (default 12.0 V)

## 0.3.10
- BLE: larger packets (MTU 247) and shorter connection interval – more throughput against “Incomplete response” with long responses and weak signal; MTU is shown in the log
- Sleep mode: the check every minute no longer writes “BLE connected/disconnected” to the log each time (fewer flash writes)
- IONIQ 5 factory profile: “AC plug” removed – stays 0 even with the charging cable plugged in; existing profiles: disable or delete the value

## 0.3.9
- IONIQ 5 factory profile: “Charging BMS” (220106) removed – the bit is 1 whenever the car is awake (12 V top-up), even without a charging cable; existing profiles: disable or delete the value
- Sleep mode: if the 12 V voltage cannot be read, a sleeping car is left alone (previously it was polled and woken up)
- Log shows when “Poll now” wakes a sleeping car

## 0.3.8
- New: main switch “Polling ON/OFF” – on the status page and in Home Assistant as a switch (<base>/polling, command to <base>/polling/set). When OFF the bridge no longer connects to the car; Test, terminal and “Poll now” keep working. The setting survives a restart
- New: let the car sleep – if the 12 V voltage is below 13.2 V (car off, not charging), no requests are sent to the car, only the voltage at the dongle is measured. Previously polling every 2 min kept waking the IONIQ 5 (12 V jumped to 14.7 V each time)
- Settings → Polling: threshold “Car asleep below” and optional “Poll while car is asleep” (every N min); “Poll now” always polls
- Status shows “Car awake/asleep” with voltage; Home Assistant: new sensor “Car awake” (<base>/car_awake)
- Fix: the 10 min pause “No valid response” also triggered on incomplete responses although the car was awake – now only when the car does not respond at all
- IONIQ 5 factory profile: longer response timeout (ATSTFF) against incomplete multi-frame responses (existing profiles: change init command ATST96 → ATSTFF or restore factory profiles)
- Less CAN traffic: identical requests are sent only once per poll cycle (previously e.g. 220105 up to 3× per cycle)
- IONIQ 5 factory profile: new experimental values “Charging”, “DC charging”, “AC plug” (220101 byte 12, per WiCAN) and “Charging BMS” (220106 byte 27, per evDash) – please verify with Test

## 0.3.7
- Settings → WiFi: IP address automatic (DHCP) or static (IP, subnet mask, gateway, DNS); button “Use current values”
- Fallback: if the static IP does not work at startup (no WiFi connection or MQTT broker not reachable), the bridge automatically gets an address via DHCP – shown in the log, under System and in the settings
- Invalid entries (e.g. gateway not in subnet) are detected when saving or at startup

## 0.3.6
- Fix: crash loop caused by a full file system – the log files could use ~96 KB of 128 KB; now max. 2 × 16 KB, and the log never uses more than 70 % of the flash (profiles/settings take priority)
- Fix: log files are only read/written under a lock – downloading could collide with simultaneous writing/rotation
- Self-healing: after 2 crashes in a row the older log is deleted, after 3 the current one too; same at startup when the file system is too full; old 48 KB logs are removed on update
- System: free heap with minimum and largest block, plus file system usage
- Status in safe mode shows the MQTT connection correctly again
- Log lines right after startup use local time instead of UTC

## 0.3.5
- MQTT: active vehicle profile at <base>/profile (+ details as JSON at <base>/profile/attributes), in Home Assistant as sensor “Vehicle profile”
- MQTT: all values including profile and timestamp as one JSON at <base>/state after each poll cycle

## 0.3.4
- Time zone as an understandable selection list (e.g. “Central Europe – Germany, Austria, Switzerland …”) instead of a POSIX string; a custom value is still possible
- Current time on the device is shown below the time zone
- Dongle is shown with its name: Bluetooth name, detected type and ELM version (e.g. “vLinker MC · vLinker / iOS-Vlink · ELM327 v2.2”), also in the status and in the log

## 0.3.3
- Profile selection shows readable names instead of file names (e.g. “Hyundai IONIQ 5 / Kia EV6”, “XPeng G9”), sorted, active profile marked with ✓
- “Save copy” only asks for a name – the internal file name is generated automatically
- Factory profiles renamed: “Hyundai IONIQ 5 / Kia EV6”, “XPeng P7+ (experimental)”

## 0.3.2
- Factory profiles: all values enabled by default (IONIQ 5, G9, G6, P7+)
- Profile table: checkbox in the “Active” column header switches all values on/off

## 0.3.1
- New factory profiles: XPeng G6 and XPeng P7+ (P7+ experimental)
- Existing devices get the new profiles automatically after the update

## 0.3.0
